    "We include tweets about the BCE, which is the entity in charge of protecting the value of the euro, but also tweets about debt crisis in Europe, because this can negatively impact the expectations around the euro. Also tweets about the economy of Europe, because this can influence the expectations of economic agents around the Euro. Specially relevant those countries with sovereing debt problems. I have included countries that experienced high interest rates during the 2008 economic crisis (above 6%, e.g., Spain or Greece; [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Long-term_interest_rates_(eurozone).png)) and countries that currently having a percentage of debt respect GDP above 85.8%, which is the average of the Euro area ([link](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269684/national-debt-in-eu-countries-in-relation-to-gross-domestic-product-gdp/)). This is specially relevant because the BCE not only acts to preserve the value of the euro but to avoid the bankruptcy of the members states, and both goals can be incompatible in certain circumstances (e.g., buy EU debt when at the same time you have to fight against inflation raising the interest rates). It is worth to mention that the Euros can be seen as liabilities that it has respect to those having euros. Of course, today we do not have gold standard, so we cannot go to the ECB ansd ask for an exchange in gold. However, the ECB has a mandate to control the value of the Euro so those with Euros will not lose value, because of this, there is a goal of 2% inflation per year, that is the limit. For example, if for eany reason there is an increase of inflation (e.g., due to high energy prices), the ECB should use its assets to buy Euros and hence remove them from circulation, this would decrease the offer of Euros, and hence increase the value of the currency. But what happens if the ECB has not enough assets to compensate? or he has assets of low quality like for example bonds from European countries with debt problems? The ECB could have difficulties to use gain capitalization through these assets and use it to stabilize Euro's value. The economic agents know this because they can see the balance of the ECB, and they can decide to go away from Euro. This sentiment of the economic agents for the Euro is what I am trying to catch here, using twitter for that."
