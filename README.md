# **Prediction of EUR/USD exchange rate**

This repository includes analyses about my data science capstone project. The goal of this project is to improve the predictions of EUR/USD exchange rate using Twitter sentiment.

## Introduction

The prediction of currencies is relevant for minimizing losses due to currency fluctuations. In this regard, the Euro is the ([second most important currency worldwide](https://www.statista.com/statistics/247362/global-foreign-exchange-market-turnover-by-currency/)), thus being its prediction relevant for many economic agents. 

The Euro is [fiat money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money), being a financial asset instead of a real asset. Therefore, it is the financial liability or debt that the European Central Bank (BCE) acquires with the holder of the Euro currency. The value of this financial asset depends on the expected services that this asset can give in the future. What can expect a Euro holder from the Euro?

Besides liquidity, economic agents hold Euros because they are backed by the European Central Bank (ECB). This central bank has assets backing the Euro. If for any reason, the demand of Euros decreases, the ECB can sell these assets decreasing the amount of Euros in circulation and stabilizing its value. In addition, the European countries with their balance can influence in the amount of Euros in the market. If these countries are spending less than they gain (i.e., profits in form of taxes are higher than the Goverments's spending), they will act as a sink of the Euro, decreasing even more its amount in circulation. In contrast, many European countries in deficit would mean Euros in circulation. 

All of this supports that the expectations of the economic agents around, not only the actions of the ECB, but also around the economy of European countries, can influence the value of the Euro. I have used Twitter to collect echoes of these expectations and improve the predictions of EUR/USD exchange rate.
